<h1>Building the Intel Cilk Plus API and Reducer Documentation</h1>
<p>
The Intel&reg; Cilk&trade; Plus API and reducer include files are annotated to allow 
you to build documentation using 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html" target="_blank">Doxygen</a>; an 
open-source program to generate documentation from source code.  Doxygen is
available at <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html" target="_blank">http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html</a>, 
and as part of many Linux distributions. The Cilk Plus documentation was 
developed with Doxygen release 1.8.6.  Using an earlier version of Doxygen may result in warnings.
</p>
<p>
To build the HTML version of the Cilk Plus documentation, change to the 
<tt>include/cilk</tt> directory and execute the command:
</p>
<pre>
    doxygen cilkplus.doxyfile
</pre>
<p>
The documentation will be created in <tt>include/cilk/html</tt>. 
To read it, open <tt><a href="file:html/index.html">include/cilk/html/index.html</a></tt> in a web browser.
</p>
<p>
Doxygen can be configured to generate documentation in a number of formats, 
including LATEX, RTF and compressed HTML. We have only tested the HTML format.
Refer to the 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html" target="_blank">Doxygen manual</a> 
if you want to generate documentation in an alternative format.
