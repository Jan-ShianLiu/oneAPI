The Intel(R) Cilk(TM) Plus `include` directory contains header files useful for Intel Cilk Plus programs.
There are:

*   Macros that provide alternative forms of the 
    @ref language "Intel Cilk language keywords".
*   @ref api "An API" for querying and controlling aspects of the Intel Cilk Plus runtime
    system.
*   @ref Reducers "Intel Cilk Plus Reducers" - both the underlying infrastructure and the 
    library of predefined reducers.
*   @ref common "Assorted macros, classes, and functions" which are primarily
    intended as support code for the API and reducer libraries, but may also  be useful in end-user code.
